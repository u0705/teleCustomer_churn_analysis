# teleCustomer_churn_analysis
Spark - machine learning application to churn prediction problem.

Here I will be covering

- Data Analysis
- Exploratory Analysis
- Model Transformers and Estimators
- Spark Machine Learning Pipeline
- ML Algorithm
- Model Evaluation and Metrics
- Building Own Metrics

Will work through each of this component to required amount. For details on other transformers and estimators you can refer to apache spark website

This spark - ML application was run by configuring Spark-3.2.1 - Scala-2.12 cluster on Databricks.
Please refer databricks tutorial from the web to learn more about how to use databricks and how to configure clusters in databricks.
